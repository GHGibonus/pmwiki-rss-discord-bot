Reads an RSS feed from the `action=rss` pmWiki endpoint and formats it to post
to a discord webhook endpoint.

This bot has two persistence files:
* `config.json`: gives hint as to where to read the RSS feed, which password to
  use and where to post the processed data. See [discord
  documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668)
* `sent.json`: records the entries (tbh, only their `pubDate`) that were
  processed and sent to the channel so that they can be filtered out of the
  messages to send to discord

`config.json`:
```json
{
    "rss_url": "https://example.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/Site/AllRecentChanges?action=rss",
    "hook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XYZ",
    "pass": "password"
}
```

## Usage

`./pmwiki-rss-discord-bot` (make sure you have the `config.json` and
`sent.json` in the working directory)
